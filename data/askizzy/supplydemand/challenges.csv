These groups might be urban, rural or remote, they might only focus on a specific part of the community (e.g. local teenagers), or a particular issue (e.g. creating safe and supportive places to meet).  However, what they have in common is needing the right data to tell their story:
- to explain how and why they are making a difference and who for, 
- to identify gaps and the next steps in further supporting their community, and
- so they know where to focus next and who to collaborate with or if they need other resources. 
Can you create a way to support one of these groups (perhaps one working on an issue that you already know about) to tell their story? 

Having the data they need to tell their story can help a group to:
- clarify what they are doing and who they are helping,
- test and re-design activities to better meet the needs in their community, 
- seek support (social, financial and political), and 
- decide when and how to collaborate with other groups with similar goals.

A successful challenge might do something similar for another issue, or take this one-step further.  It would support local groups after they have identified the need for their work, to help them find out about their community context and to re-design social programs, by knowing what activities are making a difference.

In order to provide an inclusive environment, institutions and educators need to learn how to help remove those barriers; and students need to feel that they can be involved in the process.","Typically having a higher level of education results in better employment opportunities, economic security and increased independence. However, people living with disabilities face challenges on a continual basis, that includes difficulties in participating at school leading to lower educational attainment.

People of all ages are able to access educational opportunities, but people with disabilities often lack engagement, attainment, and participation.

International,2019,109,Increased participation in Plastic Free July,"People are increasingly aware of the problems with plastics and want to ‘do their bit’ but how do we increase engagement in Plastic Free July? Using data and IT-based solutions, how can we increase both geographical update and reach a wider demographic (particularly more men)?","There is increasing awareness around the issues relating to plastics in our oceans and also our air, water, soil and even our bodies.  Tackling this issue will require a combination of approaches. Direct participation in reducing our own single-use plastic use not only adds up to make an impact and sends a message to manufacturers that we would prefer to buy less plastic as packaging but also creates a strong level of engagement and makes as a society able to drive change at a policy level in government and industry.
Plastic Free July has been found to be an effective way to engage people by setting themselves a challenge to give us as much or as little single-use plastic as they feel comfortable with for the month of July. Some of the changes that people make to their lives in July can become changes that they adopt for the rest of the year too.

Taking action for Plastic Free July is popular, yet less than 1% sign up through www.plasticfreejuly.org and social media channels. 

The questions is: ‘**how do we increase direct engagement in Plastic Free July**’?

-	A general population survey in WA shows 94% of people are concerned about plastic pollution (dataset attached)
-	Globally, waste, water pollution and plastics are considered top environmental issues (Ipsos Earth Day results attached)
-	Globally, an estimated 120 million people took action for Plastic Free July (Ipsos Global Advisor Results attached)
-	In 2017, 100,000 people signed up to PFJ web or social media. So 1% of PFJ participants in Australia sign up, 0.1% in G7 nations and 1 in 100,000 participants in developing nations.

### Supplementary issue:
One problem with engagement in environmental-positive behaviours is that they don’t manage to engage with men. Only 10% of PFJ participants are male. 

### How do we get more men to participate in Plastic Free July?

- PPQ Summary (attached) shows the uptake of plastic avoidance actions
- Media snapshot (attached) shows the public profile of Plastic Free July

Australia,2019,119,Leveraging innovation precincts to drive economic prosperity.,"How might we build on interaction between businesses and research institutions in Australian innovation precincts, to boost business capability, growth, and job creation?","Innovation precincts are place-based innovation ecosystems. They usually have a widely understood geographic extent; a shared sense of identity amongst those involved; and a strong set of formal and informal networks and partnerships between people and businesses, researchers, education and training organisations and government. 

There is strong evidence innovation precincts improve collaboration and innovation outcomes that contribute to business and economic growth. They facilitate sharing of resources, ideas, challenges and opportunities, and help businesses to access talent. They also create amenities and value for surrounding communities, and can contribute to urban renewal projects and drive regional economic growth.

There are many existing and planned innovation precincts in Australia. However, the scale of many of these precincts is much lower in Australia than in North America or Europe, and their full potential is arguably less widely understood. Some of the challenges and opportunities to consider are:

1. Information on innovation precincts’ areas of specialisation and assets, along with local supply chain opportunities, infrastructure and human capital, can guide business decisions to establish or expand operations in a particular location. It can also guide governments to target infrastructure investment and program design.

2. Successful innovation precincts are locally led and based on local competitive strengths, innovation potential and needs. They should be integrated into surrounding communities and into local, regional, national and international networks and supply chains.

3. The value of innovation precincts in encouraging end-user focused collaborative research, commercialisation and innovation is not well understood.

4. Finding suitable collaboration partners remains challenging and time consuming for both the research sector and industry, particularly for small businesses.

5. To help Australian innovation precincts to mature and reach global scale, precinct leaders must grow their expertise and capability in developing effective precincts; and precinct partners must develop their collaborative capability.

6. Innovation precincts need to articulate and market their research capabilities and competitive strengths, including internationally Stocktake of Australian Innovation Precincts – June 2019

New South Wales,2019,133,🌟 Pedestrian and Air Quality Sensor Data,How might we improve users’ experience of their city by using data from pedestrian and vehicle counters and/or air quality sensors?,"#### Smart Cities, Smart Liverpool, Smart Pedestrian Project
Thousands of people walk through Liverpool’s City Centre every day and, through the Smart Pedestrian Project, the paths they take will help shape the city’s future.

Liverpool City Council will count pedestrian and vehicle movements around the city centre, collecting data from smart devices and camera-counting technology. The data will be stripped of any identification and relayed and collected for analysis by researchers from University of Wollongong.

Council will then use this data to inform planning decisions and respond to the rising number of residents and workers making their way around the city centre every day.

#### Our Partners
Council secured an Australian Government Smart Cities and Suburbs grant to jointly fund the project.

Council is working with IT Integration Company Meshed and the University of Wollongong to deliver the technology. Meshed will supply the network and develop a wi-fi smart device counter. The university will develop the people-counting technology and data analysis.

#### The Technology
Sensors placed in key locations around Liverpool City Centre will connect through a Low Power Wide Area Network or LoRaWAN.

LoRaWAN is a low-cost network that connects wireless battery-operated devices across a wide area. It operates on low bandwidth, meaning it can only transmit small packets of data, but its low power consumption allows extremely long battery life. 

This makes it ideal for collecting data, such as pedestrian and vehicle movements or air quality.

#### Further questions:

How can people and vehicle counting sensors and air quality sensors be used to improve a user's experience of their city?

How can businesses take advantage of existing sensors and IoT networks to their own advantage?

How might local businesses or residents be engaged with existing IoT infrastructure?

How can data/sensors be used by Councils to better plan for the development of the city? I.e. where are high pedestrian counts? Do bicycle counts align with future planned bike routes? Is there enough pedestrian infrastructure in areas with high counts of pedestrians (i.e. seats/bins/lighting)? Are the most likely routes taken by visitors into the city centre? Are these routes well served by wayfinding signage?

Victoria,2019,148,🌟 School Zones: Parents rights and school enrolment pressures ,"In Victoria, all children are entitled to be enrolled at their designated neighbourhood school as a right under the legislation. How can we help parents understand their rights and schools manage their enrolment pressure?","In Victoria, all children are entitled to be enrolled at their designated neighbourhood school as a right under the legislation. Designated neighbourhood schools are generally the public school within closest proximity to the student’s permanent residential address, unless the Minister for Education or Regional Director has restricted the zone of the school. 
For children residing in metropolitan areas, Ballarat, Bendigo or Geelong, the designated neighbourhood school is usually the nearest public school in a straight line from your child’s permanent residential address. In any other area of Victoria, it is the nearest school by the shortest practicable route by distance.

All public primary and secondary schools, including Prep/Foundation to Year 9 and multi-campus schools have zone maps. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English Language Schools and Select Entry Schools. Specialist schools also do not have zones and have special enrolment criteria.
 
School zones help parents know their rights and also help schools manage their enrolment pressure. You can still request enrolment at a school that is not your designated neighbourhood school.
That school can only accept your enrolment if there is sufficient capacity at the school.  
If a school has some capacity, but not enough to fit everyone from outside its zone, the school uses the Placement Policy to determine enrolments
 
School zones are based on proximity, in some cases zone have been adjusted in recognition of significant accessibility issues, e.g. presence of a ‘hard barrier’. Adjustments are minimised to stay consistent and transparent with the standard methodology.
 
Some considerations to explore:
Zones do no align current nor forecast student demand / population to school size / capacity
In metropolitan areas, zones are defined by voronoi polygons not by road connectivity or public transport options
Sometimes there is tension between adjusting a zone to population or for improved accessibility and whats fair and equitable for schools

There is an FAQ link on the findmyschool.vic.gov website that explains zones in more detail

South Australia,2019,144,Showcasing our regions,How might we promote South Australian regions to boost regional development? ,"South Australia’s regions and the communities that live and work in them are vital for the future prosperity of the state, and we want to make sure these communities continue to grow and thrive.

The South Australian government is preparing a Regional Development Strategy as a plan to recharge our regions to ensure our regional communities can grow and thrive.

In the present state, South Australia lacks regional areas with a population of sufficient size and diversity necessary to support diverse economies. Population growth is widely acknowledged as a key ingredient for economic growth and is often coupled with higher levels of services and enhanced liveability. Having regions with diverse economies also promotes strength and resilience and the capacity to generate growth from within.

Industry growth and diversification, sustainable populations, and liveability are three key contributors to regional development.

Victoria,2019,147,🌟 Telling Stories with Open Data,"In recent years, data story telling has emerged as a powerful and engaging form of communication. Using any data that you can find on data.vic tell us an interesting story in the form of a feature article or video report.  ","Data is a powerful way to communicate complex information. It's particularly suited to helping us show where things happen and showing how things change over time. 

Data storytelling is more than simply visualising data. It allows us to combine a number of approaches to exploring different hypothesis or explore weird and unlikely correlations. 

Taking a data-centric approach to storytelling makes information more accessible to people and it helps spark curiosity and engagement with important issues. 

For this challenge we’re asking you to seek out the stories that can be told with Victorian Government Data. Your entry can be in the form of a feature article or video report.

What makes an “interesting and useful story” is deliberately open-ended, but requires a rationale for why the story is interesting and useful. It could be, for example:

- What business activities may have occurred at this place, and does this have implications for the present day (e.g. possible heritage value, potential legacy contamination, other facts of note…)?
­    - For example, which locations/areas are most impacted by potentially contaminating industries of the past, and where is the greatest risk? 
- What can we learn from patterns of past business development that may be of relevance for today? 
­    - For example, how does the data show the interaction between industries and population and how it changes through time?
- What can the data tell us about the growth and decline of specific industries over time, including any current implications?
- Or … anything else that speaks to a current issue, concern or interest.

Submissions that will appeal to the judges may involve:

- A mobile-friendly approach to accessing and viewing place-based data;
- Solutions that help improve the S&McD dataset, such as: improving the accuracy and precision of the location data; linking to other existing data sources; or allowing users to add or correct information (e.g. ‘crowdsourcing’)
- Mining the S&McD data for “interesting and useful stories”
- Something really brilliant that the judges hadn’t even considered – feel free to blow our minds!
